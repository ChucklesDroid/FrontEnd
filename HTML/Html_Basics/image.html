<!--
    The Image tag takes different attributes, here it takes "src" attribute which 
    determines the source of the image which may be a website or locally stored image
    The "alt" attribute helps to display text in case its unable to load image from the source.

    We can also manipulate the height and width of the image using "height" and "width"
    tag but in most cases doing so carelessly can change the aspect ratio .

    But we can also change the dimensions of the image without changing the aspect ratio :-
    (1) Manually by manipulating the dimensions according to the aspect ratio.
    (2) Letting html do it by only providing one dimension i.e either height or width.
