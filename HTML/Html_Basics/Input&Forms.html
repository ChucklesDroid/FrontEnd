<!-- 
    In order to get information through these text boxes from the user we need to
    make use of javascript .
-->
<!-- Basic input text box -->
        <input type="text" /> 
<!-- Text box for taking passwords -->        
        <input type="password"/>
<!-- Text box for giving default content in the text box-->
        <input type="text" value="Enter default value" />
        <br/>
<!-- We can also have a text area so instead of having a single line we have a
     huge block where we can insert text 
     Note :- we can even resize the text area. 
     We can even define attributes for a text area by giving it a specified no 
     of rows and columns .
     We can even have default text in the textarea by using the attribute "value" -->
        <textarea rows="10" cols="30"> Enter description of victim </textarea>
        <br/>
<!-- We can actually accept a multitude of inputs from the user which governs the 
     type of text . Eg:-
     (i) text   { most basic input }
     (ii) password { to input password from the user }
     (iii) date { a calender would show up from where we can select the date . Note:- Its implementation is browser dependant }
     (iv) email { its actually pretty similar to text attribute but helps in readability }
     (v) range { it gives a slider to select the range }
     (vi) file { It helps to upload a file from the localhost }

     Different types of button can also be defined
     (vll) checkbox { it is used to put a check mark in the box }
     (viii) radio { It's shape is circular and is also used to select option }
     (ix) submit { its used to submit response just like in a form }
-->
        <input type="date"/><br/>
        <input type="email" value="Enter your email"/><br/>
        <input type="range"/><br/>
        <input type="file"/>
        <br/>
<!-- Difference between checkboxes and radio buttons :-
     (i) By making use of type="checkbox" we can create checkbox where we can select 
         both the checkboxes but if we use name="default1" attribute along with type="radio" we  
         not only have created circular boxes but also we can only choose one of the two 
         options as given in example below ( this would function as long as both of
         the radio input tags have same name ).
-->
        <input type="checkbox"/>
        <input type="checkbox"/>
        <br/>
        <input name="default1" type="radio"/>
        <input name="default1" type="radio"/>
        <br/>
        <input type="submit"/>

<!-- <form>...</form> is a wrapper which is used to accept input from the user
     and makes use of javascript to do so. For now since we are learning about 
     HTML we have not gone in detail about this .-->
        <form>
            <input type="text"/>
        </form>
